# FFXIV gear calculator

The idea is to automatically calculate the best possible gear set from available gear and materia.

## Done

- Gear set damage calculation for 100 potency

## To do

- Proper support of crafted gear that can be HQ (right now it assumes NQ stats)
- Support of overmelding
- Food buffs
- UI? Web? CLI? to be decided
- Party buffs
- Calculate damage of different kinds of attacks and actions

## Far-fetched plans

- More accurate damage estimation by simulating rotation or a subset of it
- Use genetic algorithms / neural networks to automatically derive best rotation

## Out of scope

- Everything not damage-related - healing, resistence, etc.
- Combo gear pieces (like that funny 20+ tank tin can body+head armor piece)
